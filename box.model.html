        <p>11 Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsover state I am,
            therewith to be content.</p>
        <p>12 I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all
            things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and 
            to suffer need.</p>
        <p>13 I can do all things through Christ wich strengtheneth me.</p>
